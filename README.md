# Holiday Road from Nashville
 National Park Itinarary Planner

## Description

Allows users to create a travel itinerary to a park by selecting park, attraction, and eatery.

This site allows a user to select the state they wish to travel to from a dropdown menu, 
which then populates the park choices dropdown for the chosen state. Once a park is chosen,
the preview itinerary is populated with the name, picture, a 5 day weather forecast, and a details button for the selected park. 
If the user wants they can choose a different park to change the preview.

Once a park is chosen the attractions dropdown enables and you can choose multiple if you wish.
It will then mimic the park drop down and populate the itinerary preview.

Likewise, once the attractions are chosen the eateries drop down enables allowing the user to choose
and populate multiple eateries into the itinerary preview.

Once all are chosen, the save button enables and when clicked clears the preview and saves the data object to a local API.
The information is sent to an aside that shows the saved itinerary. It generates an events button and fetches the event data to display when clicked.

The user can input multiple itineraries if they wish!
