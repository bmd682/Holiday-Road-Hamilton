While Joe's has opened up outposts across the country, the original has remained popular in Miami Beach since way back when. The only thing more famous than the iconic stone crabs are the people who've dined there: according to a book written about the restaurant, they include the likes of 'Sinatra, Ali, and Jennifer Lopez.' It's true, one of the judges from the 11th season of American Idol has eaten here!",

      "description": "You know that uplifting movie We Are Marshall? The legendary Frostop is about a mile from the campus of Marshall University. And here at Frostop, legions of West Virginians have experienced the joy of having a carhop bring a slaw dog and some homemade root beer in a frosted glass right to your door. It's like a more efficient version of picking up food through a drive-thru, but this way you won't have to do that awkward reach out of your window.",

If it was the '60s and you were working a manufacturing job way back when Kenosha had those sorts of gigs, it probably tasted even better. Those hardworking guys got off of third shift and tore into that lusty combination of hash browns, grilled peppers, onion, meat, and cheese. Of course it has cheese: it's Wisconsin. The 'half' version of the dish has three eggs in it. Did we mention that it's in Wisconsin? Another fun fact: Franks seats 55 people in a rail car-style building that was made that way because it was easier to ship on the rails, not because it was a former rail car",

You don't count Teddy Roosevelt among your fans if you mess up your rib-eye. Or your bison. Or your elk. Hell, could be the ghost of the old Bull Moose is still designing the menu",
